💡 How It Works
1. The **AI logic** is powered by:
   * **Easy Mode** → AI picks random cells.
   * **Medium Mode** → AI mixes strategy with randomness.
   * **Hard Mode** → Uses the **Minimax algorithm**, making it unbeatable.

2. **Gameplay Flow**:
   * Player makes a move.
   * AI calculates the best move (depending on difficulty).
   * Board updates with animations & sound.
   * Game ends with **Win / Loss / Draw message** + modal popup.
