 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI – The Unbeatable Challenge

This project is a **modern Tic-Tac-Toe game** built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, featuring an **AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm**. The design is clean, interactive, and responsive, making the classic game feel fresh and fun.

Think you can beat the AI? Try your luck – but beware: on **Hard Mode**, the AI is nearly impossible to defeat! 🤖🔥


🚀 Features
🟢 **Difficulty Levels** – Easy (random), Medium (semi-smart), Hard (Minimax – unbeatable).
✖️ **Choose Your Symbol** – Play as **X** or **O**.
📊 **Game Stats** – Tracks **Wins, Losses, and Draws** in real-time.
📜 **Recent Game History** – Shows outcomes with **timestamps & difficulty level**.
🕹️ **Interactive UI** – Smooth animations, hover effects, and confetti when you win! 🎉
🎵 **Sound Effects** – Click feedback for every move.
💡 **Hint & Undo** – Learn strategy and retry moves.
💾 **Local Storage Support** – Stats and history persist even after page reloads.

💡 How It Works
1. The **AI logic** is powered by:
   * **Easy Mode** → AI picks random cells.
   * **Medium Mode** → AI mixes strategy with randomness.
   * **Hard Mode** → Uses the **Minimax algorithm**, making it unbeatable.

2. **Gameplay Flow**:
   * Player makes a move.
   * AI calculates the best move (depending on difficulty).
   * Board updates with animations & sound.
   * Game ends with **Win / Loss / Draw message** + modal popup.
